# :octocat:GitHunt

## Description

GitHunt is a small app that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days using data fetched from the GitHub API.
The app allows you to bookmark your favorite repositories, create repos collections and view repos' webpages all within one app.

## Technology and Tools Used

To develop this app I have used <strong>Swift 4</strong>, the new de facto programming language for iOS. That is in addition to the many libraries it provides with core functionalities such as the date etc. </br>
Along with Swift, I have used <strong>CocoaPods</strong> which provides "pods" such as <strong>Alamofire</strong> for networking and communicating with the API, <strong>SwiftyJSON</strong> to parse the JSON response and <strong>SVProgressHUD</strong> to enhance the user experience while data is loading. </br>
In addition, I used <strong>XCode 9.3</strong> as an IDE to develop my app which made it really easy to design the UI and also made the app compatible with the latest versions of iOS.

## GitHub API

To get the most starred Github repos created in the last 30 days (relative to 2017-11-22) I call the following endpoint : </br>
`https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=created:>2017-10-22&sort=stars&order=desc` </br>
You can read more about the Github API over [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-repositories).
